(nodding) It's been a wonderful experience, as we've all brought our unique perspectives and styles to the project. (smiling) I've also been working on a novel, which is a historical fiction story set in the American South. (leaning in) It's been a challenge, but also a rewarding experience, as I've had to research and learn about a time and place that's not my own. (nodding) How about you? What have you been working on lately? (smiling)"
